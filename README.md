# Custom-STM32-PCB
This project implements a reference STM32 microcontroller design on a custom PCB from Phil's Lab.

Key design goals:

Gain familiarity with professional PCB design workflows in Altium.

Apply schematic capture, layout, and design rule checking (DRC).

Practice power distribution, decoupling, and trace routing strategies used in real-world hardware.

Schematic Capture: Imported and adapted STM32 reference design in Altium.

PCB Layout:

Routed power and signal traces with attention to noise reduction.

Separated analog and digital grounds where appropriate.

Used Altiumâ€™s DRC (Design Rule Check) to validate design before prototyping.
